Given an array Arr[] of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array(containing at least one number) which has the maximum sum and return its sum.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {1,2,3,-2,5}
Output:
9
Explanation:
Max subarray sum is 9
of elements (1, 2, 3, -2, 5) which 
is a contiguous subarray.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def maxSubArraySum(self,arr,N):
        curr_sum = arr[0]
        max_sum = arr[0]
        for i in range(1,N):
            curr_sum = max(arr[i],curr_sum + arr[i])
            max_sum = max(curr_sum, max_sum)
        return max_sum
